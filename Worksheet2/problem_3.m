%% The Task: Write a MATLAB script to estimate the value of pi:
%1. Ensure the script stops when the estimate reaches a suitable degree of 
% accuracy (the error between the estimate and real value is within 
% a desired tolerance, perhaps 0.1%) HINT: use a while loop
% 2. Plot a log-scale graph of the error against the number of darts thrown
