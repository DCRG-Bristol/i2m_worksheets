%% Task 1: use the colon operator to create an array of all integer 
% from 0 to 15, store in x1
x1 = 0:1:15;
%% Task 2: use the colon operator to create an array of every other 
% integer from 0 to 15, store in x2
x2 = 0:2:15;
%% Task 3: use the colon operator to create an array of all integer 
% starting from 10 to -10, store in x3
x3 = 10:-1:-10; % or x3=fliplr(-10:1:10)
%% Task 4: use the linspace command to evaluate the 15 evenly 
% spaced points between 1 and 3, store in x4
x4 = linspace(1,3,15);
