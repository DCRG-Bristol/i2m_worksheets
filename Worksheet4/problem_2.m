%% Task 1: Write a code to simulate how temperature in the rod varies with time






%% Task 2: Using your code, simulate a system in which the rod is 
% initially at a uniform temperature of 2 units. But the ends of the rod 
% are held at a constant lower temperature of 1 unit.



%% Task 3.1: Linear initial temperature, then bringing the cool end 
% to a high fixed temperature





%% Task 3.2: Constant initial temperature, then having one end hot and 
% the other cool






%% Task 3.3: Constant initial temperature of zero, one boundary is 
% constant at zero, the other varies according to the function 
% sin(2*pi*f*t) ...
