%% 1. store the value 6 in a variable x



%% 2. add two to x, store the results in the variable y



%% 3. multiply y by 2 and subtract half of x to it, store the results in z



%% 4. use the `==` operator to check z is equal to 13
 


%% 5. learn how to use the `sqrt` command: type `help sqrt` into the command window



%% 6. store the value 16 in the variable $$t$$.
  


%% 7. evaluate the remainder of t divided by 3 using the rem command (use `help`)
    


%% 8. use the `sqrt` command to calculate the square root of t and store it in $$x$$



%% 9. calculate the square of x using the `Ë†` operator, store the results in t2
   


%% 10. use the `==` operator to check t2 is equal to t
    


%% 11. set `t=10` and repeat steps 8-10.
