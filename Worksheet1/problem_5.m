%% Task 1: use a for loop to display each element of `A` one at a time, 
% at the same time evaluate the sum of `A`, store the result in `S`.

clear; clc; % clear the workspace, and remove all text from the cmd window

A = [6 8 4 2 -5 0 0 1 -4];
n = numel(A); % number of elements in A (i.e. 9)

for i=1:n % in this loop "i" will successively take the value 1,2,...,9

end

%% Task 2: using a for loop, check if each element of `A` is greater than 
% its next element, store the indices in an array variable named `id`.

%% Task 3: use a for loop to identify the element of `A` greater than 3, 
% and decrease their value by 1, store the result in `B`.

%% Task 4: use a for loop to remove the element of `A` that are negative, 
% store the results in `A2`.
