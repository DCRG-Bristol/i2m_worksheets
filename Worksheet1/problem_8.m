%% Task 1: calculate the sin of 0.1𝜋, store in x



%% Task 2: calculate the sin of the 45 degree angle



%% Task 3: evaluate 30 evenly spaced points between 0 and 2𝜋, store in x



%% Task 4: use a for loop to evaluate the sin of 30 values evenly spaced between 
% 0 and 2𝜋, using the variable x you just created, store the result 
% in the array y



%% Task 5: repeat the above without using a for loop



%% Task 6: use the plot command, to plot/create a visual representation of
% y as a function of x



%% Task 7: use the xlabel and ylabel commands to add labels to your figure



%% Task 8: use the plot command, to plot/create a visual representation of 
% 2sin(x) as a function of x



%% Task 9: use the hold on command to plot both sin(x) and 2sin(x) 
% on the same figure




%% Task 10: use the close all command, to close all figures
