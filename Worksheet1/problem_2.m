%% 1. create a small 1D array (e.g. a vector), named A, containing the numbers 0, 2, 5, 8, 9




%% 2. replace the fourth value of A with the number 1




%% 3. subtract 1 to each element of A, and store the result in X




%% 4. add all the values of A using the sum command, and store in s




%% 5. multiply each element of A by itself (i.e. element-wise multiplication), store in B




%% 6. take the transpose of A, store in At




%% 7. use the find command to find the index of element of A equal to 5, store the result in id5.




%% 8. find the indices of all element of A greater than 3, store the results in idAbove3




%% 9. replace all element of A greater than 3, with the number 66, store in A66




%% 10. find the indices of all element of A which are not equal to 2, store in idNot2
